The cube's facing sides are used to play the game "CUBE," which has a side dimension of two.
Three digits are used to identify a location, for example, 1, 2, 1.
The goal is to move one horizontal or vertical (not diagonal) square at a time from 1, 1, 1 to 3, 3, 3 without running into one of the five randomly planted landmines.
You can stake up to $500 and place a wager on whether you'll arrive at your destination before each game play.
If you step on a mine or attempt to move illegally, such as changing more than one digit from your starting place, you lose.
