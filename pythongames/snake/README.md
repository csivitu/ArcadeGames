Welcomme to Snake, This is a simple and fun game, made with python.    

<h3 > Introduction </h3 >

Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a growing line that becomes a primary obstacle to itself.    
The concept originated in the 1976 two-player arcade game Blockade from Gremlin Industries.    

Controls:
- W - Up
- S - Down
- A - Left
- D - Right

When one of the control buttons is pressed the game is started,    
the goal of the game is to eat as many red dots as possible, each red dot accounts to one point.

If the snake bites/touches itself the game ends.
