### High IQ

This is a computerized version of an old European solitaire game of logic. The game starts with a pegboard shaped like a cross having pegs in every hole but the center. The object is to remove all 32 pegs, or as many as possible, by jumping into an empty hole, then removing the jumped peg.

There are several different winning strategies for playing, and of course, each strategy can be played eight different ways on the board. Can you find a consistent winner?

Charles Lund wrote this game while at The American School in The Hague, Netherlands.
