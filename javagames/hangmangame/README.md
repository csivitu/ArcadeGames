### Introduction

Hangman is a word-guessing game played by two or more players. One player is tasked with choosing a word. The word is represented as a series of "dashes" indicating the total number of letters. Players take turns to guess letters to spell out the entire word. For each incorrect letter, a part of the "hangman" is drawn.

### Game Rules

In this version of the game, there is one Player and the word is chosen by the Computer. The Computer prompts the Player to enter a letter each turn. The letter is then checked with the chosen word. If the letter is not present, the next body part of the "hangman" is drawn. 

The following body parts of the "hangman" are drawn:
* Head
* Body
* Right arm
* Left arm
* Right leg
* Left leg
* Right hand
* Left hand
* Right foot
* Left foot

**Win Condition:** The Player must guess all the letters of the Computer chosen word.
**Lose Condition:** All body parts of the "hangman" are drawn before the word is guessed.
