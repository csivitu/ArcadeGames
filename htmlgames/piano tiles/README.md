#ABOUT 
## The goal of Piano Tiles is for the player to tap on the black tiles as they appear from the top of the screen while avoiding the white. When a black tile is tapped, a piano sound is produced. Famous compositions such as "FÃ¼r Elise" and "Ode to Joy" are formed in quick succession.
Tiles
There are two types of tiles showing on the screen during normal game play. There are other types of tiles during the Arcade+ mode but that is a different story.

##Separating tiles
This means that the player has to move his/her fingers to another box after tapping one tile, then tapping another, repeating the sequence. Pro modes only have separating tiles. This type is harder as moving one's fingers is required.

##Continuous tiles
This means that the player does not have to move his/her fingers to another box after tapping one tile; staying at the same place will do and just tap another tile that comes down from the same row. Pro modes do not have continuous tiles.

##Rows
The background normally has 4 rows for the tiles to fall down from. The easily distinguishable white colour it has gives players a better sighting of the tiles (especially when the tiles are black). There are 5 or 6 rows in 5x5 and 6x6 modes.

##Currency
There is in game currency called notes. There are two ways to get notes:

##Entering the game everyday to get bonus notes, but the number of the notes are always unpredictable.
Play the game, thus getting notes according the score after losing. You get notes every time you play, unless you get 0 points (tapping the white tiles at the background before starting the game gives you 0 points too).
Notes can be used to buy songs, reviving yourself after losing and getting head starts.

##Reviving
After you lose, you can choose to cancel (means to just lose and not reviving) or using notes to revive yourself. The more points you get before losing, the more notes you need to revive yourself to continue the game. In the revive button will show how much notes you need to revive yourself. After reviving, the button you missed will become the start tile and you press it to continue the game.

##Head starts
Before starting a play, you can use notes to exchange for head starts. There are options for a 50 tile hehead start, nothing can be touched and you can only just see the tiles flying away. After the head start, the first tile not included in the head start will become the start button.
