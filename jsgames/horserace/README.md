# HORSERACE

This program simulates a one-mile horse race for three-year old throughbreds. Up to ten people may place bets on the race up to $10,000 each. However, you may only bet to win. You place your bet by inputting the number of the horse, a comma, and the amount of your bet. The computer then shows the position of the horses at seven points around the track and at the finish. Payoffs and winnings are shown at the end.
